Dynamic Multi-Tenant Database Switching in Spring Boot
This project implements a Spring Boot 3 (Java 21) REST API with dynamic database switching for each tenant (user).

Every user has their own database.
If a user's database does not exist, it is created on the fly.
Uses Spring JDBC, HikariCP connection pooling, and ThreadLocal context for multi-tenancy.

âœ… Efficient Connection Pooling â€“ Uses HikariCP for fast and optimized connections.
